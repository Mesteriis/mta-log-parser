<h1><img align="center" height="50" src="https://github.com/drlight17/multi-mta-parser/raw/master/postfixparser/static/images/logo.png"> Privex Multi MTA Log Parser with Web UI</h1>



This is a small application designed to parse the log output of SMTP servers (postfix, exim and sendmail are supported for now), and convert it into easily queryable data inside of [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/).

It includes a Web UI built with [Quart](https://github.com/pgjones/quart) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - allowing
for easily navigating and filtering the log data straight from your browser.

**DISCLAIMER:** The Web UI only includes a very basic password prompt which reads the password from the `.env` file.
This application is NOT intended to be public facing - we strongly recommend for production use-cases that it's
kept restricted within a corporate VPN / LAN.

There's also no requirement to run both the Web UI and the actual log parser/importer on the same server, as the
parsed data is kept in RethinkDB - thus you can run the WebUI on a separate server as long as it has access to the
RethinkDB server. Dockerized is designed to run on the same server, but you can simply edit Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml to your needs.

Dockerized usage (recommended for production and development)
========

**Pre-requirements**
- Docker.io (tested on 23.0.2)
- Docker-compose (tested on 2.9.0)

```
git clone https://github.com/drlight17/multi-mta-parser
cd multi-mta-parser
cp example.env .env

# Adjust the example .env as needed. Make sure you set SECRET_KEY to a long random string, and change ADMIN_PASS 
# to the password you want to use to log into the web application. Other variables are described. 
nano .env

# To build and run app with web GUI run
docker-compose up -d

# To stop app with web GUI app run
docker-compose down

# To schedule log parsing add to your crontab (every minute in example)
crontab -e
*/1  *   *   *   *   docker exec -t multi-mta-parser flock /tmp/lck_mmp /app/run.sh cron

# Rethinkdb web gui is available on the port 8080 (you may change expose port in .env).
```

Install in your system (not recommended)
========

**Pre-requirements**

 - [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/) (for storing the queryable log data)
 - Python 3.7 MINIMUM (will not work on earlier versions)
 - Pipenv (`python3.7 -m pip install pipenv`) - for creating a virtualenv + installing dependencies


```

apt update -y
apt install -y python3.7 python3.7-dev python3-pip

python3.7 -m pip install -U pipenv

adduser --gecos "" --disabled-password mailparser
# To ensure that the parser is able to read the mail.log, add the user to the appropriate groups
gpasswd -a mailparser syslog adm postfix

su - mailparser

git clone https://github.com/drlight17/multi-mta-parser
cd multi-mta-parser
pipenv install

cp example.env .env
# Adjust the example .env as needed. Make sure you set SECRET_KEY to a long random string, and change ADMIN_PASS 
# to the password you want to use to log into the web application.
nano .env

# Add a crontab entry to run the parse/import script every minute or so
# You should use a file lock utility such as `flock` (included by default on Ubuntu) or `lckdo` to prevent the
# cron overlapping if there's a lot to parse.

crontab -e
# *  *   *   *   *    flock /tmp/lck_mailparser /home/mailparser/multi-mta-parser/run.sh cron

####
# DEVELOPMENT
####

./run.sh dev         # Run the development server with automatic restart on edits
./run.sh parse       # Import MAIL_LOG immediately

####
# PRODUCTION
####

exit

# (AS ROOT)

# Production systemd service for the WebUI
install -m 644 /home/mailparser/multi-mta-parser/multi-mta-parser.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable multi-mta-parser.service
```
Nginx reverse proxy
===================
If you want to use nginx reverse proxy for WebUI  with the URL path, i.e."/logs" ( like https://domain.org/logs ), make sure you have added PATH_PREFIX=/logs
var into .env file):
```
location /logs/ {
   location /logs/static/ {
       proxy_pass http://domain.org:8487/static/;
   }
   proxy_pass http://domain.org:8487;
}
```

Here's the important parts:

 - If you use this software (or substantial parts of it) to run a public service (including any separate user interfaces 
   which use it's API), **you must display a link to this software's source code wherever it is used**.
   
   Example: **This website uses the open source [Privex Postfix Parser](https://github.com/Privex/postfix-parser)
   created by [Privex Inc.](https://www.privex.io)**
   
 - If you modify this software (or substantial portions of it) and make it available to the public in some 
   form (whether it's just the source code, running it as a public service, or part of one) 
    - The modified software (or portion) must remain under the GNU AGPL v3, i.e. same rules apply, public services must
      display a link back to the modified source code.
    - You must attribute us as the original authors, with a link back to the original source code
    - You must keep our copyright notice intact in the LICENSE.txt file

 - Some people interpret the GNU AGPL v3 "linking" rules to mean that you must release any application that interacts
   with our project under the GNU AGPL v3.
   
   To clarify our stance on those rules: 
   
   - If you have a completely separate application which simply sends API requests to a copy of Privex Postfix Parser
     that you run, you do not have to release your application under the GNU AGPL v3. 
   - However, you ARE required to place a notice on your application, informing your users that your application
     uses Privex Postfix Parser, with a clear link to the source code (see our example at the top)
   - If your application's source code **is inside of Privex Postfix Parser**, i.e. you've added your own Python
     views, templates etc. to a copy of this project, then your application is considered a modification of this
     software, and thus you DO have to release your source code under the GNU AGPL v3.

 - There is no warranty. We're not responsible if you, or others incur any damages from using this software.
 
 - If you can't / don't want to comply with these license requirements, or are unsure about how it may affect
